# Inventory Optimization Analysis Report

This project analyzes inventory transactions across multiple retail stores to optimize stock management and improve profitability. Using Power BI, the analysis explores product inflows, outflows, and net balances, while applying DAX measures to generate actionable insights.

### Business Problem

Inefficient inventory distribution across stores led to risks of stockouts, overstocking, and unnecessary carrying costs.

### Objectives

Reduce inventory carrying costs

Minimize understocking & overstocking

Improve profitability through optimized stock distribution

### Data & Methodology

Data Source: Inventory transactions table (fields: Date, Store, Product, Quantity In/Out, Unit Price)

Data Cleaning: Handled nulls, standardized product names, ensured proper date formatting

Tools Used: Power BI (Power Query, DAX)

Key Measures:

Net Stock = In – Out

Movement Ratio = Out ÷ In

Visuals: Bar charts, matrices, slicers, store-level filtering

### Key Insights

Rice: Most frequently moved product with the highest movement ratio → demand is strong.

Beans: Risk of understocking in some months despite high inflows at Kano store.

Maize: Overstock in some stores, shortages in others → inefficient distribution.

Seasonal Trends: Demand spikes during harvest and festive periods.

### Recommendations

Increase Rice supply to high-demand stores (e.g., Kano, Lagos).

Balance Beans distribution across stores and explore secondary suppliers.

Redistribute excess Maize stocks and promote sales in overstocked stores.

Align procurement cycles with seasonal demand and implement predictive models.

Enable centralized monitoring and real-time replenishment alerts in Power BI.

### Outcome

#####The analysis helps management:
* Prevent stockouts and overstocking
* Improve operational efficiency
* Optimize supply chain decisions
